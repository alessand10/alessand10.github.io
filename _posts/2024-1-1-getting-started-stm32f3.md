## Introduction

The STM32F3 series of microcontrollers offers an excellent entry point into ARM Cortex-M4 development. With features like hardware FPU, DSP instructions, and various built-in peripherals, it's a powerful platform for embedded projects.

## Key Features

- ARM Cortex-M4 core with FPU
- Up to 72 MHz clock frequency
- Rich analog features including op-amps and comparators
- Multiple communication interfaces (I2C, SPI, UART)
- Integrated USB 2.0 full-speed interface
- Debug support via SWD/JTAG

## Development Environment

To get started with STM32F3 development, you'll need:

- STM32CubeIDE or your preferred IDE
- ST-Link debugger
- STM32F3 Discovery board (recommended for beginners)
- Basic understanding of C programming
