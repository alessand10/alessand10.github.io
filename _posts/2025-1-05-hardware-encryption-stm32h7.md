## Introduction

The STM32H7 series includes powerful cryptographic hardware accelerators that can significantly improve security while maintaining high performance. This article explores how to effectively utilize these features in embedded applications.

## Hardware Capabilities

- AES encryption/decryption (128/256-bit)
- Hardware random number generation (HRNG)
- SHA-256 hashing
- Public key cryptography acceleration (PKA)
- True random number generator (TRNG)

## Implementation Overview

This guide will demonstrate:
- Initializing the CRYP peripheral
- Implementing AES-256 encryption
- Using hardware random number generation
- Best practices for key management

[Detailed implementation guide coming soon]
