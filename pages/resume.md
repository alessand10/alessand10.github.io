I have a strong passion for embedded systems, firmware development, and 
real-time computing. As a developer, I enjoy working close to the hardware, optimizing for resource-constrained environments,
and developing efficient solutions for complex embedded challenges. I'm particularly interested in IoT devices, computer vision, microcontroller programming,
and real-time operating systems.
